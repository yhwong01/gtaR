# Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct provides guidance for creating a safe, positive, and efficient working environment. It outlines social norms, acceptable behavior, and general etiquette to ensure inclusivity and respect among all contributors.

## Key Components

### Inclusivity Statement
We are committed to fostering a harassment-free, inclusive environment for all contributors regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or religion.

### Expected Behavior
- Contributors are expected to be respectful, constructive, and collaborative.
- Abusive, harassing, or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.

### Unacceptable Behavior
This includes but is not limited to:
- Verbal or written harassment.
- Discriminatory language.
- Personal attacks.

### Reporting Procedure
Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported to the project maintainer via email or a designated reporting tool. All reports will be handled confidentially.

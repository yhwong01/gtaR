## Overview
GTA (Greater Vancouver's Taste Analytics) is an R package that simplifies access to restaurant-related data for the cities within the Greater Vancouver Area, such as Vancouver, Burnaby, Richmond, Surrey, and Coquitlam. The package provides structured data retrieval, filtering, and visualization capabilities, making it easy to analyze restaurant details such as names, addresses, ratings, categories, and more.

### API Chosen:
For this project, we have chosen to wrap the [Yelp Fusion API](https://docs.developer.yelp.com). Yelp Fusion API provides extensive and detailed restaurant data that perfectly aligns with our academic and personal interest in gourmet exploration within the Greater Vancouver Area. Yelpâ€™s API is robust and well-documented, offering detailed business information including restaurant names, addresses, ratings, user reviews, hours of operation, photos, reservation availability, and more. These comprehensive features allow us to achieve our analytical and visualization objectives effectively.

## Installation
To install the GTA package from GitHub, use:

```r
library(remotes)  
install_github("yhwong01/gtaR")  
```

Load the package after installation:
```r
library(gtaR)
```

## API Key Setup
Before using the package, you need to set your Yelp API key in your `.Renviron` file:
```r
Sys.setenv(YELP_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here")  
```
Ensure you restart your R session for the changes to take effect.

### API Key Handling

The function `get_yelp_api_key()` is a helper function used internally by other package functions to securely retrieve the API key. Users do not need to call this function directly. Instead, ensure that the API key is set up correctly in your environment before using any package functions that interact with the Yelp API.
